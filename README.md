- **Data Management:** Implemented a relational database using [insert technology used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL] to facilitate efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- **Inventory Management:** Created functionalities for tracking medication stock levels, orders, and supplier information to avoid stockouts or overstock situations.
- **Data Analysis:** Provided tools for analyzing purchase trends, which aid in better inventory forecasting and decision-making.
- **User Interface:** Developed a user-friendly interface for pharmacy staff to manage daily operations seamlessly.

**Benefits:**

The implemented database system enhances operational efficiency by streamlining inventory management processes, improving data accuracy, and enabling better decision-making through data analysis. This project ultimately contributes to improved customer service and operational effectiveness within the pharmacy sector.
